        It's never too early to plan your penny-saving with a Steam Sale
        schedule. In times past, predicting Steam sales was more soothsaying
        than science, but we're in a beautiful new world of predictable price
        cuts. Nowadays, Valve reveals Steam Sale dates well in advance, major
        seasonal sales serve as reliable quarterly landmarks, and—best of
        all—there's no messy augury required. Still, with Steam now rolling out
        frequent genre-specific sales, it can be helpful to have someone keeping
        the calendar. That's where we come in. We're tracking all the confirmed
        Steam Sale dates as they're announced, so you can focus on curating your
        wishlist. You're welcome.

        Raise a city from the ground up and transform it into the thriving
        metropolis only you can imagine. You've never experienced building on
        this scale. With deep simulation and a living economy, Cities: Skylines
        II delivers world-building without limits. Lay the foundations for your
        city to begin. Create the roads, infrastructure, and systems that make
        life possible day to day. It's up to you – all of it. How your city
        grows is your call too, but plan strategically. Every decision has an
        impact. Can you energize local industries while also using trade to
        boost the economy? What will make residential districts flourish without
        killing the buzz downtown? How will you meet the needs and desires of
        citizens while balancing the city's budget? Your city never rests. Like
        any living, breathing world, it changes over time. Some changes will be
        slow and gradual, while others will be sudden and unexpected. So while
        seasons turn and night follows day, be ready to act when life doesn't go
        to plan. The most realistic and detailed city builder ever, Cities:
        Skylines II pushes your creativity and problem-solving to another level.
        With beautifully rendered high-resolution graphics, it also inspires you
        to build the city of your dreams. AI and intricate economics mean your
        choices ripple through the fabric of the city. Remember that as you
        strategize, problem-solve, and react to change, challenges, and
        opportunities. Cities: Skylines II lets you create without compromise.
        Now you can build sky-high and sprawl across the map like never before.
        Why not? Your city is you. Your decisions shape each citizen's life
        path, a chain of events that defines who they are. From love and loss to
        wealth and wellbeing, follow their life's ups and downs. Pick a map to
        set the climate of your city. These are the natural forces you'll
        negotiate to expand your city amid rising pollution, changeable weather,
        and seasonal challenges. READ
